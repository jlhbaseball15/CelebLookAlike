### Requirements  
- XCode

### Setup

   Once you have Cocoapods installed, navigate to the project directory and run `pod install`. This will download the 
   libraries we will be using to build this project.

   In the project directory, there are two APIs that have already been written and included so that we can focus on the core
   project.
  - Google Custom Search
  - SightEngine
	
   Once you have completed all of this, you should be ready to follow along with the tutorial
